    <p class="c12"></p><a id="id.gjdgxs"></a><h1 class="c12 c26" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c13 c11">Prologue</span></h1><p class="c12"><span class="c22 c20">Nothing out of the Ordinary</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c13 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><br><span class="c1">Somewhere in the distance you hear an echoing, resonant sound you are all too familiar with. That stupid bell that rings at the end of each period.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, in some extremely rare cases such as this one, you would consider the bell not a symbol of impending death, but a welcome end to all the death that has occurred prior. Death of your brain cells, that is. You think you&rsquo;ve done enough calculus for a lifetime, and by that you mean not only are you willing to throw all this knowledge out a window for the foreseeable future, you&rsquo;ll feel like kicking the bucket if you try to cram any more in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the teacher dismisses the class, and before you realize what is even going on, students bolt out of the room in uncanny groups of three or five. In fact, you only fully awaken from your nice afternoon nap when your &ldquo;beskie&rdquo;, as she calls it, bestows upon you the splendid and bountiful gift of one swift smack to the back of your head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: hey, friendo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: class is over.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">FRIENDO: Huh, is that so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: yeah, didn&rsquo;t you hear the bell?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: remember you once said &ldquo;it ingrains itself into the subconsciousness of even the most mentally uncompromised&rdquo; or something like that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: not even a sleepy sleepy owl like you couldn&rsquo;t have heard it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">FRIENDO: Again with the owl stuff?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: sorry, couldn&rsquo;t help myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She shrugs helplessly, at the whim of her own imagination.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re always so silent&hellip; and yet so sudden sometimes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: that&rsquo;s what i like about you ;) hehe</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">OWL: Well I do appreciate the metaphor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">OWL: Also thanks for waking me up, I guess.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: no problem buddy :3</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: you finally gonna join the class for lunch? or you&rsquo;re sitting at the small round table again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Eh I think I&rsquo;ll keep the status quo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: aww man you&rsquo;re being an owl again?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: thought if there was any day of the year you&rsquo;d like to make a change it would&rsquo;ve been today&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: happy birthday, by the way. don&rsquo;t think i forgot. :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Heh, thanks Sophie. I can always count on you to remember.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: hey, call me your beskie. or bestie, or deskie.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Alright, &quot;beskie&quot;. Whatever floats your boat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: aw thank you, zeph. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: see you around the cafeteria then, eh?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: See you there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She gets up and leaves the classroom. By this time, you are the last person left.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Slowly, you shake off the lethargy accumulated from math period like a heavy blanket of snow, and head down to the cafeteria to get a much, very much needed bite.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While walking down the stairs your mind can&rsquo;t help but reflect on what kind of conversation you had with Sophie earlier. That might just have been the most sincere conversation you two have ever had since you first sat together about three months ago. You know you tend to be pessimistic at times, but genuinely you are puzzled at how she hasn&#39;t gotten tired of your personality yet. It&#39;s probably something that comes with the benefit of being &quot;deskies&quot;, you guess. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On certain bouts of frequent self-introspection such as this one, you can&#39;t help but wonder if those who say they appreciate you are hiding something from you, as if they&#39;re only tolerating you and waiting for the right moment to break off when they think you won&#39;t notice. A very dangerous thought if you&#39;ve ever thought about one. Ah, there you go again, being pessimistic. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s okay, no one has to know. Your life, as much as you would like to believe it could be, isn&#39;t some grand dramatic story wherein you are the main character and your friends, &quot;beskie&quot; included, are side characters helping you in your quest to attain Maslow&#39;s topmost tier. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although, now that you think about it&hellip; If you were part of a work of great fiction, who would you paint yourself to be? How would you introduce your character? You think having to keep up a &quot;character&quot; with a certain &quot;personality&quot; all the time would tire you out. As your &quot;beskie&quot; said, you prefer to be &quot;sudden&quot;. But who would even deem you entertaining enough to watch anyway? No one except the bored, the aimless, and those with too much time to kill, you presume. That&#39;s why you&rsquo;re 98% sure your existence couldn&#39;t possibly live up to a fictional title. And yet, you have a knack for trying (successfully or not) to prove yourself wrong. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Your name is Zephaniah Aisling, although Zephaniah is quite a mouthful, so on the rare occasion that someone actually uses your name in conversation they use the convenient short form Zeph. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Long story short, you&rsquo;re a pretty weird guy. At least that&rsquo;s the impression the rest of the class gives you. You can&rsquo;t help but feel every time you want to socialize, you unwittingly get blocked by someone else. And every time you do, people look at you like you&rsquo;re a made up character in a storybook. Of course, you don&rsquo;t blame them. You rarely blame anyone, because you know it&rsquo;s most probably your fault. Confidence just doesn&rsquo;t come as easily to you as it does to some other people you know. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You reach the ground floor after what feels like a one-odd page of exposition and head towards the cafeteria, where you figure practically everybody with a social life is probably currently at. Ah, lunch period. A reprieve from the horrors of the three-hour sensory assault before it. A refreshing stream in the middle of a haunted forest. An oasis of respite in the middle of a scorching desert. Before you can cook up any more metaphors you arrive at the place where they cook up actual food, and find your rightful place at a peculiar bench for four, somehow always half-covered in sunlight and half-covered in shade. However, just like any usual day, it serves its function as a bench for one. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You put your schoolbag down and head to the stalls to get some food. On the way back you spot one Sophie Keller waving rather enthusiastically across the cafeteria. You still don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ready to join her group of friends just yet. Firstly, a substantial number of them are from the neighbouring class and so they don&rsquo;t really know who you are, which intimidates you. Secondly, and arguably more importantly, they&rsquo;re mostly girls, which intimidates you further. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You want her to know that you&rsquo;ve acknowledged and appreciated her gesture, and yet establish that you&rsquo;re not really feeling up to it right now. So in a very Zephaniac fashion you stare back at her, raise your eyebrows quizzically and walk in the opposite direction. At least from what you see out of the corner of your eye, she returns the eyebrows, so you hope she gets what you mean.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You have a pretty decent and average lunch. It&rsquo;s the same bowl of rice with the same few meats and vegetables as you had around this time last week. No harm can come from the familiar, you always say. Plus, it&rsquo;s one of the less-patronized stalls in the cafeteria, so not only do you never have to queue up for your food, you&rsquo;ve convinced your altruistic side that you&rsquo;ve made some contribution to that kind old lady chef&rsquo;s revenue. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After you finish your food and return your bowl and utensils to the collection area like a Good Boy, you hang around idly and contently for another half an hour or so. Not having to entertain a large group of friends every lunch break can be liberating, you think. Imagine being there and, like, talking to people and all that. Heh. It would be really nice, but you already know every time you tell yourself you&rsquo;re going to make a change tomorrow you&rsquo;ll just end up repeating what you&rsquo;ve already said the previous day.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You get your bag and start walking off to the auditorium where the last (and definitely most exciting) period of the day, Drama, will be held. If all goes according to plan, which it usually does, you&rsquo;ll get there about 10 minutes before most others. But, you never know. Maybe since it&rsquo;s your birthday the universe will decide to surprise you or give you a gift. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Halfway there you feel a tap on your right shoulder, accompanied by a familiar, sing-song voice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">VOICE: Hey, zeph :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh, hey Avis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Being early as usual, i see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hmm yeah.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You&rsquo;re early today too though. I thought you&rsquo;d still be with your friends in the cafeteria around now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Well, i told them i&rsquo;d be ditching them a little early just for drama these few weeks</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Gotta prepare for the stage rehearsal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: Oh yes, you are the titular Mockingbird from the hit play </span><span class="c16 c20">The Mockingbird</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;by Samsara Fayruz. How could I forget?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Heheh~</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She chuckles: a warm, distinctive laugh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Are you jealous?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Jealous? No way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: If anything, I&rsquo;m horrible at acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Hmm, gotta work on confidence then. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: I don&rsquo;t know, acting is just kind of a mindgame</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: It&rsquo;s like a bunch of people decided to drop you straight into some weird fever dream and the person who plays along the best gets rewarded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah, it&rsquo;s all about suspension of disbelief, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: The what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You know, the suspension of disbelief.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Ehh i don&rsquo;t know what that means. I&rsquo;m not that good on the vocabulary</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well it&rsquo;s quite simple--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Hey on second thought i don&rsquo;t think i want to know. LOL</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">You force out a smile, but it&rsquo;s a genuine one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Anyway, yeah. Guess in this class i&rsquo;m that person who came out on top. Just hope i deliver for the festival.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Eh I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll pull it off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Really?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well yeah, there&rsquo;s clearly a reason you were selected. I guess they see something special in you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You considered saying &ldquo;we&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Awww. You&rsquo;re being honest?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Honesty is one of my only redeeming qualities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Wow. Maybe that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re bad at acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heh.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You two reach the auditorium, still early, but around three minutes later than your usual time. A negotiable amount. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Alright, I gotta go get my costume and makeup done and all that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Catch you in the lights and sounds booth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Wow, you&rsquo;ve like, acknowledged that we exist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Do people not notice you guys?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: You, soph, 2 or 3 others?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I assure you, they don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Aw, maybe later in the play the mockingbird will fly up off the stage into the lights and sounds booth and give everyone in there a high five. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: We shall see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Heehee~ Ok i&rsquo;ve gotta go</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Wish me luck</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah don&rsquo;t worry about it, you have what it takes. I mean, that&rsquo;s why we selected you for lead role in the first place, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Aww, thanks~</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: I&rsquo;ll be sure to do my best for you guys :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: All the best.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She slinks into the actors&rsquo; room backstage and closes the door behind her with an almost imperceptible click. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are actually quite impressed at how you held up against her. Avis&rsquo; personality is definitely not one you&rsquo;d trifle with. It feels like her vitality radiates from her in an aura, almost like she&rsquo;s bringing out the confidence in you whenever you talk. Anyway, that&rsquo;s about the third or fourth time you&rsquo;ve talked since you two have met, so you can&rsquo;t really make generalizations. You do admire her for that, though. Even when you first met her she already had something you&rsquo;d never see yourself having. Almost like it&rsquo;s effortless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everyone in the class has been so busily preparing for the Drama Festival that takes place near the end of the first semester. You feel a little pity for the aesthetic departments: when in comparison to whatever you&rsquo;re doing, it feels like they&rsquo;re doing way more work. Regardless, it&rsquo;s not your business to judge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After everyone arrives about 5 minutes after the formal start of the period (as usual), your class&#39; drama teacher, Mr Zac, gives a pretty long briefing on how the opening scene should feel like. Theoretically, everybody in the class already knows this, but this is the first time you guys have practiced, so you guess a reminder would do everyone some good. At some point the actors come out and you spot Avis and the other &quot;characters&quot; all in full costume. You must say, they look completely different under the spotlight on the stage, it&#39;s almost stunning. Looks like the costume people really pulled through on this one.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR ZAC: Alright children, rehearsal is the most important thing today. After this, we&#39;re done. LNS guys, get to the booth. Actors prepare yourselves. Rehearsal will begin in 5 minutes. Everything good? Ok, get going! </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the students scramble to their places. You do a sound check in the booth, and everything goes fine. Sophie runs a lights check too, and she gives everyone a thumbs up to let the crew know everything is fine too, although it seems more like she is on the verge of giving you a hug.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The rehearsal begins. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Curtains open and everyone goes silent. A dim yellow light casts its rays onto the floor of center stage, growing in intensity until it floods the whole set. Meanwhile, your audio crew plays a track of birds humming and chirping in the distance. The result is a serene image of a morning forest, basking in its own glory, teeming with flora and fauna.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You lean forward in your chair, attentive to the impending cue&hellip;always 17 seconds in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">14&hellip;15&hellip;16...17. You switch to another track.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Let the show begin.</span></p>

The music jumps into a flurry of entangled notes, softly at first but with the promise of crescendo soon to come. Entering from the left starts a mockingbird, endowed with a single vibrant blue feather. She clumsily flies through the foliage to escape the hunter trying to capture her. While she evades the hunter&rsquo;s efforts, with her stamina fast depleting-- while she thinks it is safe, she is finally caught.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c18">MOCKINGBIRD: What are you doing, child?

I will keep you safe</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c11">MOCKINGBIRD: You will?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: I promise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: WHO BE THERE?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The hunter appears from behind a shrub, his voice looming over the pair of younglings as equally as his stature.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19">HUNTER: Boy, have you seen a tiny little mockingbird around here?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: No, I have not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: No? It was just flying around these parts. It is a vile creature, unlike the rest of its kind. I am only finding it for its one blue feather.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: Oh, well then I have seen the bird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: You have?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: It was flying through the trees, &nbsp;in the direction you came from. I did not know it was a mockingbird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: Excellent. It cannot go much further than the clearing. Thank you for your guidance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: You&rsquo;re welcome, sir.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The hunter continues his trek in search of the vile creature. With that, the child carries the beautiful mockingbird in his arms, and returns home.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR. ZAC: Hey, that was pretty good! Good job Avis and Jackson. Michael, you need to be more unfeeling. Not exactly bright and angry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">MICHAEL: Sure thing, sir!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR. ZAC: Other than that, nice work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c23">MR. ZAC: Ok, that&#39;s all for today people. Let&#39;s pack up and leave this place. The sun&rsquo;s going to set soon, and I wanna eat my dinner on time. Class dismissed!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">STUDENTS: Thank you Mr Zac!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The students keep the props, close the curtains and switch off the lights. As the three actors take off their masks and start chattering about the events of the day, a shy boy walking down the steps can&rsquo;t help but look at the trio and wonder what it would be like if he was among them, if only for a minute.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21">Another nice acting job by the three characters, it seems. While you&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of theatre, you appreciate all the effort it takes to keep up those appearances. You&rsquo;re terrible at pretending, you think. You&rsquo;d love to be on stage, commanding the attention of a whole audience, but if the past 17 years of your life have told you anything, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s not a good idea to have so many eyes on you at any one time. That&rsquo;s why when the class decided to do </span><span class="c21 c20">The Mockingbird </span><span class="c1">for the upcoming Drama Festival your school holds every year, you immediately defaulted to the Lights and Sounds section. Ironically, it&rsquo;s the darkest and quietest section of the play when it&rsquo;s actually running. Nonetheless you absolutely love your time there, because drama is one of the only periods where you don&rsquo;t feel like someone is watching you, waiting for you to do something stupid.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anyway, enough about you. Now&rsquo;s not the time to metaphorically beat yourself up, you already did that a few nights ago. Also, today&rsquo;s your birthday for goodness sake! You&rsquo;re allowed to celebrate what little character strengths you have, if only for a single day. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You walk out the school gate with a little more spring in your step than usual, catching your neighbour and close friend near the bus stop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hey, Alex!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh heeey. what&rsquo;s up, bro?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Nothing much. Just got off the last period which was drama.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c14">ALEX: man, I love drama. you know, the Drama Fest is coming up pretty soon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: what play is your class doin&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: Oh, we&rsquo;re doing </span><span class="c16 c20">The Mockingbird </span><span class="c2">by Samsara Fayruz. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14">ALEX: haven&rsquo;t heard of it. my class really wanted to do </span><span class="c5">1984</span><span class="c14 c11">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Wasn&rsquo;t that a novel?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: yeah, the original was written by some guy called Jorjor Well. so we&rsquo;re following some random guy&rsquo;s drama adaptation, and it&rsquo;s shaping up quite nice if I do say so myself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well, that&rsquo;s great for you guys.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: still chillin&rsquo; in the LNS?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah, there&rsquo;s no place like it. I really love the atmosphere there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: or lack thereof. Heh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: it&rsquo;s boooring. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Psh, that&rsquo;s what you think.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: that&rsquo;s what everyone thinks, pal. why stay in that dusty cramped room with all the projectors and switches and knobs and equalizers when you can be out there, under the spotlight, acting on center stage? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He makes a dramatic clench of his fists, as if on cue, to illustrate his point. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: the gaze of the audience, transfixed on your every movement. man, knowing you have the power to change the audience, sway your character&rsquo;s fate, knowing you can be the one essential lens between fiction and reality, doesn&rsquo;t that excite you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">Zeph assembles every last shred of his melodramatic, performative spirit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: But fiction with all its own bells and whistles is still fiction. Predetermined, calculated, and even if followed to the dot and comma, is still merely an escape from reality which cannot hold forever. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: How stressful is it, leading the people watching you into your world of dreams, only to collapse it all into dust when the curtains close for the day?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I simply take no excitement from watching the whimsical or supernatural, and having people pretend it is real.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I like Lights and Sounds precisely because it carries with it its own reality, its own life in the notes and the chords, in the light and in the dark. It is its own pure simulacrum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: heh. that was a pretty dramatic monologue, I&rsquo;ll give you that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: maybe you really should be out there acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heheh, big words coming from Mr. Second Lead Role, I guess.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: ehh, how&rsquo;d you find that out?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Word gets around. I eavesdrop on people sometimes. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Also come on, you practically radiate deuteragonist energy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: aww, I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two talk all the way until the bus leaves their stop, past sunset. By the time they reach their houses, the night has fallen.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: alright man, great talk today.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: happy birthday, by the way. don&rsquo;t think I forgot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh, thanks. I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it, actually.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My parents are out across the country for work this time of the month, so they did tell me to video call them for today.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: you&rsquo;ll be alone for a few days again? why not crash at my place? my parents and I can bring out the inflatable mattress.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My parents would object.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well, that&rsquo;s what they would say if they were here!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: slumber party, woo!!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heheh, I do want to cook something of my own, though. In case your parents made dinner or something again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh yeah, my mom texted me saying she was baking a casserole tonight. wait, hang on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: you don&rsquo;t mean your instant ramen stash, do you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hell yeah I do. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh my god.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Anyway I&rsquo;ve already chosen a pretty nice one for today. Tried and tested. It&rsquo;s a miso flavour.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: wow. whatever bro, it&rsquo;s your day. I won&rsquo;t judge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: expect you to be at my door in an hour? I&rsquo;ll save some cass&rsquo; for supper.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Sure, an hour is more than plenty.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: enjoy your miso, man. see ya 8.20!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: See you in a bit, Alex.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You unlock the front door and enter. The house, once filled with warmth, feels cold and almost foreign. Well, that is, until your parents come back in a few days to lighten things up again. You love your parents. Unfortunate that they had to leave the state this morning, of all mornings. Anyway you call them once you settle down. The talk goes great, honestly. It&rsquo;s happier than approximately 85% of your usual conversations with your parents. Maybe about 50% if you omit all the laundry and dishes reminders. After you and your parents hang up, about 25 minutes have passed, and you&rsquo;re quite famished.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You open a cabinet meant primarily for laundry detergent, and remove the fresh-smelling fodder to retrieve your prized possessions. Ah who are you kidding, they&rsquo;re literally just packets of instant ramen. Your parents would murder you if they found out you spend 30% of your school budget by hopping over to the Asian supermart 2 blocks from school every once in a while and popping a few bucks on these babies. You&rsquo;re no ramen expert, but damn the Asians know their stuff.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You grab a Miso Flavour ramen packet. It&rsquo;s a well-seasoned taste you discovered a few months ago and have not been able to stop trying ever since. You walk off to grab a scissors to open the packaging, and--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c24">?????: hey.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">--wait what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: what do you think you&rsquo;re doing, buddy?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A calm and composed voice, rather similar to Alex&#39;s, echoes throughout the house and yet seems to linger just out of his field of view, trailing behind him like a shadow. A very puzzled Zeph checks the windows to see who it is, and finds absolutely no-body there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hold on, Alex. Where are you, exactly?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard your voice from the outside of the house.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">????? giggles softly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: silly boy, i&rsquo;m not Alex. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m inside your head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: don&rsquo;t talk out loud like that, people will think you&rsquo;re going insane.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: And so I am going insane.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: no, you&rsquo;re not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: you know, i&rsquo;ve been a part of you since the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;ve been watching, growing up with you, influencing you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph feels something step through the door and into the kitchen, even though the door is closed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh my god.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: What </span><span class="c16 c20">are</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m everything you hate, everything in yourself you want to put away, your worst fears, your nightmares, your failures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph collapses into a nearby chair as visions swell up in his mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: why, i&rsquo;m everything you don&rsquo;t want to be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: and yet, i&rsquo;m everything you have, aren&rsquo;t i?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Holy shit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That&rsquo;s not true. You can&#39;t say that. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: come on, you can&rsquo;t lie to yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: </span><span class="c16 c20">[tearing up] </span><span class="c2">No&hellip;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: you&rsquo;re surrounded by massively more successful people, who have no time for all your whims and intricacies. you have no one who truly understands you, no one to tell your worries to, no one to be comforted by&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: no one to blame but yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Stop this, whoever you are, stop this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: if you ask me, it&rsquo;s PATHETIC.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: STOP IT!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Why are you coming to torment me, to remind me of all this on my birthday? It&rsquo;s nothing I don&rsquo;t already know! I&rsquo;m supposed to be happy, why can&rsquo;t I feel like it?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: hush, sweetie. again, nobody can hear you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: although, that&rsquo;s exactly my point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i appear because despite it being your special day, you&rsquo;re all alone. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Zeph breaks down and sobs quietly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: anyway, cheer up. i haven&rsquo;t bothered you much today, but i felt like now would be a perfect time to make myself known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: we&rsquo;re only allowed to reveal ourselves explicitly from a certain age, anyway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That&rsquo;s&hellip;stupid and weird&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, rules are rules. oh well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph picks up the scissors to cut open the noodle packaging.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: oh, and one last thing. i&rsquo;ve always wanted to try that really spicy korean one at the back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: &hellip;Why should I care about what you want?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: woah buddy, i sense some charged language right there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My first impression of whatever you are isn&rsquo;t very good.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, i expected that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: anyway, just a suggestion. you don&rsquo;t have to do what i say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: although i would very much like you to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: which means at least a part of you will enjoy it as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: &hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You pause for a brief moment to contemplate it. You honestly bought that thing as a joke, a cruel prank to play on Alex, or anyone whom you happen to hate one fine day. But you guess the person you hate most right now is yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Fine, whatever. If even my own negativity manifests itself--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: excuse me, &ldquo;herself&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hold on, what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, deal with it. this is the first time i&rsquo;m using a voice, though, so i just borrowed Alex&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That explains it a little bit. Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be me?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: haven&rsquo;t you been curious to see who&rsquo;d you become if you were a girl?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Touche. Don&rsquo;t tell that to anyone else, though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: don&rsquo;t worry, i&rsquo;ll keep it to yourself,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: If even my own negativity manifests </span><span class="c16 c20">herself </span><span class="c2">and tells me to try a different flavour of instant ramen on my 17th birthday, then I must really want to try this, eh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: thaaaat&rsquo;s the spirit!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: thank me later.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With that, the pressure and dread that had insidiously seeped into the atmosphere of the kitchen was suddenly lifted. Zeph goes to the ramen stash to examine the spicy ramen packet. It&rsquo;s touted as &ldquo;HOT Chicken Flavour Ramen&rdquo;, meant to be eaten dry. There is an unsettling amount of red in the picture of the noodles on the front. He takes the spicy ramen packet and puts the miso packet back in its stash to be eaten in a few days or so, who knows. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I&rsquo;ve never been a person who craves spicy foods. Guess I&rsquo;ll get a verdict tonight&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He cooks the noodles, drains the water and mixes the flavour packets into the bowl. The resulting aroma is extremely enticing, although the noodles look even more red and intimidating than they did as advertised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh boy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You better be right about this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He begins eating and the pain gets to him, first on his tongue, and then flaring through his nostrils with subsequent bites. He got up again, two minutes later, to grab a carton of milk from the fridge. It was really damn spicy, but hey, it tasted really good. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A mix of pain and euphoria from the added spice. Zeph was hooked.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c22 c25">TO BE CONTINUED IN</span></p><h1 class="c12 c26"><span class="c13 c11">Chapter II</span></h1><p class="c12"><span class="c20 c22">A Mid-Autumn Night&rsquo;s Dream</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p>
