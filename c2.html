    <p class="c17 c14"><span class="c26 c28"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Although it feels like a lifetime after you took that first bite of one exceedingly spicy noodle, it&rsquo;s surprisingly only been 45 minutes. Well you have some regrets, but less than you had expected. Maybe you&rsquo;ll change your mind tomorrow when it comes out the other end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">It&rsquo;s 8.17pm, and you&rsquo;ve changed into your pyjamas and headed over to Alex&rsquo;s house as promised. You ring the doorbell and wait. The door creaks open a few seconds later. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: well well, look who finally decided to show up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: It&rsquo;s been less than an hour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: I know, I was just being dramatic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">ALEX: also that&rsquo;s a line from Act 4 in </span><span class="c11 c13">1984</span><span class="c11 c9">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Is it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: yeah, I think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Alright mister second lead, I believe you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: pshhhhh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: come on in!</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You step inside Alex&rsquo;s house, and it&rsquo;s pretty much the same as you&rsquo;ve always seen it: a little messy, but pretty cozy too. Seems like you haven&rsquo;t visited this place in ages, though. And yet things still stay oddly familiar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">ALEX&rsquo;s MOM: alex is that zephaniah at the door?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She pops out of the kitchen, one hand still enveloped by an oven mitt that was definitely not made with her small hands in mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I&rsquo;m here Mrs. Hargrave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: oh hi sweetie :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: wanna try some casserole? i whipped it up with random stuff i had in the fridge haha</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: mom don&rsquo;t say that! he won&rsquo;t try it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: why not :(</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: he doesn&rsquo;t like surprises, remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: he doesn&rsquo;t?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">At least you thought you didn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Uh actually I think I&rsquo;m game for some casserole right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Do you guys have enough to spare?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: oh we have plenty (3 </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: did you think we&rsquo;d have offered some if we could&rsquo;ve finished it all by now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Haha, don&rsquo;t mind me then I&rsquo;ll help myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You three head to the dining table and you take a small slice of the casserole because you&rsquo;ve technically already eaten dinner but hey, the night is still young, you suppose it couldn&rsquo;t hurt. Oh damn, it&rsquo;s really not bad. You know, under normal circumstances you would&rsquo;ve given this a pass, but today keeps getting farther and farther away from what normal people would call normal circumstances so you&rsquo;re just giving in to fate at this point. Guess either Mrs. Hargrave is really good at whipping up random things in the fridge or they had some real good stuff in there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: -mmmm it&rsquo;s good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: haha, glad you like it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: as you know, my mom&rsquo;s cooking is the best in the neighbourhood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: -mm true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: awwwwww you boys make me so proud</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">MRS. HARGRAVE: I&#39;ll leave you alone then. make yourself at home, zeph. I&#39;ve got some k-dramas to watch!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She disappears into the living room.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: wow, thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to try the cass. <br>ALEX: you know how much greens she put in there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I have no idea, but it tastes pretty good, so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: heheh, that&rsquo;s my mom&rsquo;s cooking for you. seems like you really enjoyed it, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: so did you actually end up eating instant noodles again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Oh, I thought since it was my birthday I should be silly and try something new for once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: So I opened the spicy korean one that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try for a while now, but never had the courage to get past the packaging for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: wait holy shit, I think I&#39;ve eaten that one before. your spice tolerance is actually horrible how the hell did you survive that??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: You know, maybe I didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Maybe a portion of my soul left me the second I took the first bite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Guess we shall never know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: hey, I heard recently they came up with a 2x spicy version.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Oh hell no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I am not doing that with you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: oh come on, you&rsquo;ve made suuuch a great valiant effort so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: don&rsquo;t you want to tryyyyy it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Anyway your threshold is way higher than mine, if you&rsquo;re going to have to do all the heavy lifting, then I don&rsquo;t see a point-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: -ehhhhhhh maybe during the next summer break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9">ALEX: now that&rsquo;s what i like to hear HAHA</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The two of you retire upstairs in Alex&rsquo;s bedroom, where he has the inflatable mattress all laid out, ready and positioned for a night full of handheld console gaming and movie watching. A fun-filled night ensues. It&rsquo;s really the most fun you&rsquo;ve had all week. You guys don&rsquo;t even have to worry about staying up this late because the next day you get to report to school later than usual. Thank god it&rsquo;s Friday. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">It must&rsquo;ve been a good few hours before the two of you finally settle in and hit the sheets, ready to rest and recharge for a final day of the week tomorrow. It would&rsquo;ve been great to get home early before sundown like you normally do on Fridays, but for tomorrow the class is rostered to do a dry run for </span><span class="c19 c13">The Mockingbird, </span><span class="c6">officially marking T minus 7 days until all hell breaks loose and oh who are you kidding the class is going to absolutely slay the performance. You genuinely believe in it. In them. In everyone. You&rsquo;re scared, and excited, and everywhere in between.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You finally close your weary eyes, exhausted from the day&rsquo;s events. Thoughts are swimming in your head like the noodles in your bowl of instant ramen. What was that thing that came to you before dinner anyway? Was all that for real? Certainly that was not normal at all. Nothing&rsquo;s ever come close to making you break down like that in sheer despair, except yourself. Well, then you guess at some level she was right. You&rsquo;re willing to admit you haven&rsquo;t been the most bold, daring or confident person. But you&rsquo;re probably just hallucinating or whatever. Surely sleep paralysis demons don&rsquo;t actually exist. Today&rsquo;s just been a long, really long day&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Right as you think that thought, you fall asleep---</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c16">---and relinquish your control over to me, once again. Like you do every night, unknowingly yet unfalteringly. It&rsquo;s funny how mortal you are. How little faith you have in my existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c16">You really can&rsquo;t hear me, but I must say our first official meeting went much, much better than I initially expected. Turns out spending weeks planning paid off quite well. I thought you&rsquo;d freak out more. You&rsquo;re pretty cute, too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c16">I guess I&rsquo;m saying that out of necessity. Our souls and fates are intertwined, after all. Ergo, I&rsquo;m stuck with you as much as you are stuck with me. Two sides of the same coin. It&rsquo;s a pact that goes beyond the both of us, made before we even knew who we were. Before you were in the womb, and before I&hellip; actually I don&rsquo;t even know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c16">But enough about me. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very good idea to let a shadow hog the spotlight. Let&rsquo;s get back to you. You&rsquo;re beginning to have a dream. That seems like a pretty tempting invitation&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Somewhere in the distance you hear an echoing, resonant sound you are all too familiar with. That stupid bell that rings at the end of each period.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">However, in some extremely rare cases such as this one, you feel like you&rsquo;ve done all this before somehow, so you perk up and sit upright in your deliberately uncomfortable school chair, trying to jolt some consciousness back into you. It appears that lesson has ended though, so it turns out you kind of woke up for nothing. Well, guess it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to go back to sleep-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: [SLAP]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">-okay maybe it would.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: hey friendo!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: class is over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Is that so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: yeah, didn&rsquo;t you hear the bell?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: remember you once said &ldquo;it ingrains itself into the subconsciousness of even the most mentally uncompromised&rdquo; or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: not even a stupid fool like you couldn&rsquo;t have heard it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Wait, what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: sorry, couldn&rsquo;t help myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">She shrugs helplessly, at the whim of </span><span class="c10">your</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;own imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re always so silent&hellip; and yet so sudden sometimes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: that&rsquo;s what i hate about you ;) hehe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Wait, surely all this happened differently. Sophie wouldn&rsquo;t say something like that&hellip; would she?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: sure i would, dummy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: can&rsquo;t you tell i&rsquo;m tolerating you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;you&rsquo;re not her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: what are you talking about, sleepy owl?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: i&rsquo;m just too kind to say the truth to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">That&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;re putting your foot down on this bullshit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Shut up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Is all this a game to you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Get out of my head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9">SOPHIE: silly boy, you still don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re talking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: why, this headspace is ours to share. :)</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You&#39;re wrenched out of your seat into a freefall. Suddenly you&#39;re miles above the clouds and skydiving straight toward the earth. You hear Sophie&rsquo;s laugh. You have no idea where it&#39;s coming from, or how it&#39;s even possibly there in spite of the wind rushing past your ears, but you hear it. Sophie usually has a sweet bubbly laugh, but there&#39;s something about it now that terrifies you. You can&#39;t put your finger on it, but you can feel it. Seeping its way into the core of your being. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You fall even faster downward, and by that you don&#39;t mean the usual 9.81m/s&sup2; gravitational acceleration kind of faster. You&#39;re literally being dragged down. You breach the clouds and realise you&#39;re directly on top of a lake covered with some weird green stuff. Oh they&#39;re just giant lily pads- wait, it&rsquo;s daytime, why is the water pitch black??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">Okay you are kind of really flipping out, and decide now is as good a time as any to let out a visceral scream. </span><span class="c10">Ah, music to my ears~</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;Then you realise that nobody can hear you except her, and you really don&rsquo;t want to give her what she wants, so by sheer force of will you stop screaming. </span><span class="c8 c16">Impressive, but you&rsquo;re avoiding the issue, aren&rsquo;t you? :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">The very next second, you plunge into the water and black out instantly. </span><span class="c10">Wow, you just lost consciousness in your own dreams. That&rsquo;s pretty funny. I really ought to make him feel better after this. Can&rsquo;t be a villain all the time, huh? I&rsquo;ve definitely been having too much fun. Hurting is only on my agenda as long as it&rsquo;s arguably constructive- if anything, he&rsquo;ll survive and come back stronger. Don&rsquo;t worry, I have it all planned. After all, I know </span><span class="c19">myself</span><span class="c8 c16">&nbsp;better than I know anyone.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You wake up gradually, soaking in the sunlight as feeling and sensation return to your body and you lie on one of those giant lily pads you saw earlier. Wait, earlier? The realisation of what happened hits you like a boomerang, just in time for you to also realise that you&rsquo;ve been laying on Sophie&rsquo;s lap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: WHOA WHAT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: so you&rsquo;re finally awake. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: welcome back :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: WHAT IS THIS?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: calm down, dude. it&rsquo;s just a dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I need to get out of here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You frantically get up and search for a way out, quickly realising that there isn&#39;t one. The lake stretches hundreds of metres in diameter, and you do not want to touch that suspicious water again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you forget i&rsquo;m the one in control. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: So I&rsquo;m just s-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: -stuck here, yeah. with me ;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Ugh, dammit!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You sit down at the edge of the lily pad, defeated. She gets up and starts walking over with a spring in her step, way too cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I guess this is one of those lucid dreams, huh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you can&rsquo;t escape from me. you really don&rsquo;t have the will to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: so it&rsquo;d be in your best interest to stay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Am I supposed to believe you&rsquo;re acting in my best interests?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: hopefully. negativity can be constructive, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Are you hearing yourself right now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: yes, perhaps in more ways than one. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Very funny.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">By this time she sits down, and she&rsquo;s only a meter or two away from you. It&rsquo;s Sophie, but you can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that it only looks like her. A wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: &ldquo;a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo;?? really??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Well what was I supposed to think? You&rsquo;re clearly not her. If you&rsquo;re trying, I think you&rsquo;re doing a horrible job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i&rsquo;m not trying, but you&rsquo;re right. she&rsquo;s too precious for you to be her friend :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Oh shut up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Why don&rsquo;t you just be yourself, whatever you really are? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: &hellip;you sure you can h&#821;&#777;&#845;a&#820;&#775;&#802;n&#820;&#771;&#798;d&#822;&#769;&#804;l&#823;&#861;&#851;e&#823;&#788;&#806; &#822;&#850;&#845;i&#820;&#859;&#827;t&#823;&#787;&#793;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She glares at you- wait no she just looks over, but her eyes are pitch black and her pupils glow a vibrant lime green. It&rsquo;s a harmless facial expression, but you can&rsquo;t explain why it feels horrifying, and it&#39;s not just the eyes. It sickens you, and you recoil reflexively. She shrugs casually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: told ya.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i have a real form, but i really don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever be able to look at me the same way again. too much sludge. too much nightmare fuel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: sophie here is just easier on your eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She gives an innocent thumbs up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Poor word choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: intentional word choice. i always know what you&rsquo;re thinking, remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I really don&rsquo;t like her that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i know. i&rsquo;m just cracking a joke. i love to make you uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She giggles, and you feel that fear shoot up your spine again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: whoops, let my voice out again a little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: sorry, i&rsquo;ve been having so much fun toying with you recently. i&#39;ll try not to let it slip, promise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Please do not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: anyway, this isn&rsquo;t like one of those regular nightmares where i mess with you a little then leave randomly like nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Wait, you do those?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i see you&rsquo;re curious about me now. that&rsquo;s good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: who else do you think pulls the strings, zephaniah? i weave every single one of your dreams.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: It&rsquo;s a little weird calling me that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24">?????: fine, </span><span class="c2">ZEPH</span><span class="c5">. but i&rsquo;ve always found little purpose in shortening such a nice name ;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I am seriously beginning to wonder whether you hate me or not. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: can&rsquo;t it be both? hehe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i do love confusing you though. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: That you are doing pretty well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: thanks for the compliment. been doing this for a little over 17 years now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: A little over 17?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: well, it&rsquo;s technically already Friday, so 17 years and 1 day, to be exact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Hmm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: it&rsquo;s great you&rsquo;re asking questions about me. i&rsquo;m really not used to the attention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She looks away, almost like she&rsquo;s blushing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Oh, so you&rsquo;re the unconfident one now, huh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She stares straight into your soul, with her normal eyes this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: no, i&rsquo;m just messing with you again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Screw off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: heheh alright, enough screwing, i wanna get to the point.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">She shifts a little closer to you. You shift away, almost instinctively. </span><span class="c10">Not because it&rsquo;s not Sophie. I know you&rsquo;re just shy, even if it </span><span class="c10 c13">was </span><span class="c8 c16">her. You don&rsquo;t want to face me, face anyone, but we&rsquo;ll get there one day. Just you wait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i want an open sharing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you get to ask me anything, and i&rsquo;ll answer you as much as i can.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: All this seems pretty harmless. Where&rsquo;s the catch?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: there is none. and i&rsquo;m not messing with you this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: heh, you thought i was purely malicious? i&rsquo;m capable of good too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I don&rsquo;t know, I think you made it pretty clear when you first talked to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: yeah, that&rsquo;s precisely why we&rsquo;re having this conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i don&rsquo;t want you to think i&rsquo;m just beating you down for my own enjoyment or anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">She puts a hand on your shoulder. </span><span class="c8 c16">There is zero malice in it, but you flinch anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: like, i&rsquo;m not gonna kill you or anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: but i want acknowledgement, and i want equality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: the only way to become a more confident person is to gain the ability to stare your fears straight in the eyes, and win that staring contest when it stares back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: instead you bottle up your emotions, and it&rsquo;s really not very good for you in the long run.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: You&rsquo;re sounding like a psychiatrist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: are they not echoes of your own common sense?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i know you&rsquo;re perfectly content with the lack of change. you&rsquo;re comfortable where you are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: that&rsquo;s why i had to be the bad guy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: remind you a little. scare you a&#820; litt&#820;&#780;&#827;le&#820;&#777;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She injects a little bit of her nightmare fuel into that last sentence deliberately, and you soak it up like a sponge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: ;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: so just know that i&rsquo;m trying to help you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i&rsquo;m still you, after all. by technicality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I suppose I can&rsquo;t refuse your help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: if you could, then i&rsquo;d be pretty useless, wouldn&rsquo;t i.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">You let out a chuckle. </span><span class="c8 c16">Hollow, but genuine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;probably still less useless than me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: now thaaat&rsquo;s the self-deprecating humour i like to hear!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i think i&rsquo;ve done enough monologuing. any questions?</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">You sit back and think pretty hard about all this. Maybe this is why you always get the feeling that somebody is looking at you, because you&rsquo;re always looking at yourself. You kind of understand her position? </span><span class="c10">I hope you do, at least.</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;Taking whatever she&rsquo;s been saying at face value, you guess it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to have to navigate the fine line between horrific love and Lovecraftian horror. </span><span class="c10">Hey, nice wordplay, but I didn&rsquo;t say I was a Lovecraftian horror. I&rsquo;m not a cosmic entity, and I don&rsquo;t have any tentacles. Eldritch, maybe.</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;Anyway you put all the emotionally complex issues aside, and start thinking philosophically about the implications of the actual existence of supernatural beings, such as your </span><span class="c10">(cute, amazing, approachable)</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;local sleep paralysis demon. Wait, demon? </span><span class="c8 c16">Hold on, are you really about to ask me-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;you&rsquo;re a demon, huh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Is God real?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She bursts out laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24">?????: &hellip;why would you think i had the answer to that???</span><span class="c19"><br></span><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Well you said you were a demon, so-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: okay i didn&rsquo;t mean that in the biblical sense, dumbass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Hmph.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i don&rsquo;t know the answer, man. but i sure hope there is one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Wait so if you don&rsquo;t come from hell, then where-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: -alright i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m allowed to tell you that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Well this has been a very fruitful Q and A session so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: yeah, it sure has.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: but i thought you&rsquo;d have Other questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Like??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: what i think about your friends??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I thought you told me I had no friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: and you believed me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: awwww, poor poor thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">She literally teleports behind you?? And gives you a hug from the back. You feel a shred of terror. It&rsquo;s lingering somewhere inside &ldquo;Sophie&rdquo;, no matter how hard she really tries to hide it for your sake. Regardless, you are really not sure how to react. </span><span class="c8 c16">Believe me when I say it shows. :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24">????? </span><span class="c24 c13">[sighing]</span><span class="c5">: this is exactly why you need my help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: ???????????</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I know she&#39;s not the one you like, but you do want affection. Validation. You might need it, even. To grow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: let&rsquo;s go back to the topic of your friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Alright, going back to the topic of my friends. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Trying to ignore what you are doing but appreciating the sentiment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: hmmm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Hmmm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Does everybody have some sort of inner demon personification like me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: now those are the sorts of interesting questions i&rsquo;d love to cryptically answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you ask because nobody you&rsquo;ve met has ever shown their other side to you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: well you&rsquo;ve never tried to look, but we do keep ourselves well hidden, by any metric.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &ldquo;We&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: so there&rsquo;s your answer. ;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;This has been an uncomfortably long hug.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: man, it would have been uncomfortable for you even if it was for a single second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;True.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: well go on with your questions. time&rsquo;s almost up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Do dreams even have time limits?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: your mind is approaching the threshold of consciousness. it&rsquo;s already nearly there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: anyway i&rsquo;ve been pretty lax about controlling the flow of time today. spells like that are the most tedious to keep up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Spells??</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: dude why does this come as a surprise to you didn&rsquo;t i tell you i&rsquo;m a literal demon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She grips your shoulder and suddenly the two of you are levitating half a mile high in the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: HUH</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you know, i find it really funny when you get scared like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You take a moment to process the situation and are so relieved you are not in another goddamn freefall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Oh my god. At first I didn&#39;t realise we were suspended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24">?????: nahhh. didn&rsquo;t want to shock you awake. i think it&rsquo;s been a pretty pleasant dream so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Actually, how do I wake up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: wow, you just hurt my feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: No no, I was just curious. Do you even have feelings anyway?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: well, i&rsquo;m just as human as you are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: except the nightmare fuel. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: and the physical form, of course. :)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Interesting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: How the hell are you still hugging me, by the way. I don&rsquo;t know which way is up anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: you should have been in enough dreams to realise that dream physics is totally messed up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Doesn&rsquo;t help that I forget my dreams almost immediately after waking up, huh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: oh, that&rsquo;s my doing. i keep forgetting you don&rsquo;t remember all that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: but i could Not do it if you valued this conversation that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Hm. I think I&rsquo;ll take that offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Just as a harmless final question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Is it socially acceptable for people to be hugging for this long?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c24">?????: well i don&rsquo;t know, but do you think social norms apply to me anyway?</span><span class="c6"><br>She giggles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i just think it&rsquo;s a small gesture one person can do for another to show concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;&ldquo;one person for another&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;so are you actually just me, or are you something else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: well Alright it&rsquo;s been Fun tonight i think you need to Leave now hee hee!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: Hey wait-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">She taps you on the forehead with her palm and you fall unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">What feels like a few moments later, you wake up just a few minutes before the alarm clock is set to go off at 8.30am. You look at Alex. He&rsquo;s fast asleep. Anyway you guys only have to be in school by 10am, so you&rsquo;re not in a rush. Oh. The dream. They say you can pinch yourself to check whether you&#39;re still dreaming or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">You pinch yourself. </span><span class="c8 c16">Dumbass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Holy shit. You&#39;re not dreaming. You actually remember everything. You wonder if she&rsquo;s still there. If she even really existed in the first place, or if you just dreamed her up. Well now you don&#39;t really doubt her, but you&#39;ll have to see it with your own two eyes to truly believe. That&#39;s just who you are, and she probably knows that too. What&#39;s she gonna do, appear right in front of you or something? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Anyway, you thought of one last question just before she bonked you and sent you back from the Shadow Realm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: &hellip;Hey, are you still there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: i&rsquo;m always with you, stupid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Sophie&rsquo;s voice rings inside your head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c9">ZEPH: I&rsquo;ll whisper.

You can tell it&rsquo;s really her this time, because a chill runs down your spine. Maybe you should start getting used to this feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: my my, i was beginning to worry you&rsquo;d never ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">?????: &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">LEILA: call me leila. :) </span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c8"></span></p>
