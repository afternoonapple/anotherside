    <p class="c12"></p><a id="id.gjdgxs"></a><h1 class="c12 c26" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c13 c11">Prologue</span></h1><p class="c12"><span class="c22 c20">Nothing out of the Ordinary</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c13 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><br><span class="c1">Somewhere in the distance you hear an echoing, resonant sound you are all too familiar with. That stupid bell that rings at the end of each period.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, in some extremely rare cases such as this one, you would consider the bell not a symbol of impending death, but a welcome end to all the death that has occurred prior. Death of your brain cells, that is. You think you&rsquo;ve done enough calculus for a lifetime, and by that you mean not only are you willing to throw all this knowledge out a window for the foreseeable future, you&rsquo;ll feel like kicking the bucket if you try to cram any more in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After the teacher dismisses the class, and before you realize what is even going on, students bolt out of the room in uncanny groups of three or five. In fact, you only fully awaken from your nice afternoon nap when your &ldquo;beskie&rdquo;, as she calls it, bestows upon you the splendid and bountiful gift of one swift smack to the back of your head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: hey, friendo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: class is over.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">FRIENDO: Huh, is that so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: yeah, didn&rsquo;t you hear the bell?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: remember you once said &ldquo;it ingrains itself into the subconsciousness of even the most mentally uncompromised&rdquo; or something like that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: not even a sleepy sleepy owl like you couldn&rsquo;t have heard it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">FRIENDO: Again with the owl stuff?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: sorry, couldn&rsquo;t help myself&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She shrugs helplessly, at the whim of her own imagination.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re always so silent&hellip; and yet so sudden sometimes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: that&rsquo;s what i like about you ;) hehe</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">OWL: Well I do appreciate the metaphor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">OWL: Also thanks for waking me up, I guess.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: no problem buddy :3</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: you finally gonna join the class for lunch? or you&rsquo;re sitting at the small round table again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Eh I think I&rsquo;ll keep the status quo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: aww man you&rsquo;re being an owl again?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: thought if there was any day of the year you&rsquo;d like to make a change it would&rsquo;ve been today&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">BESKIE: happy birthday, by the way. don&rsquo;t think i forgot. :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Heh, thanks Sophie. I can always count on you to remember.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: hey, call me your beskie. or bestie, or deskie.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">BUDDY: Alright, &quot;beskie&quot;. Whatever floats your boat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: aw thank you, zeph. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">SOPHIE: see you around the cafeteria then, eh?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: See you there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She gets up and leaves the classroom. By this time, you are the last person left.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Slowly, you shake off the lethargy accumulated from math period like a heavy blanket of snow, and head down to the cafeteria to get a much, very much needed bite.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While walking down the stairs your mind can&rsquo;t help but reflect on what kind of conversation you had with Sophie earlier. That might just have been the most sincere conversation you two have ever had since you first sat together about three months ago. You know you tend to be pessimistic at times, but genuinely you are puzzled at how she hasn&#39;t gotten tired of your personality yet. It&#39;s probably something that comes with the benefit of being &quot;deskies&quot;, you guess. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On certain bouts of frequent self-introspection such as this one, you can&#39;t help but wonder if those who say they appreciate you are hiding something from you, as if they&#39;re only tolerating you and waiting for the right moment to break off when they think you won&#39;t notice. A very dangerous thought if you&#39;ve ever thought about one. Ah, there you go again, being pessimistic. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s okay, no one has to know. Your life, as much as you would like to believe it could be, isn&#39;t some grand dramatic story wherein you are the main character and your friends, &quot;beskie&quot; included, are side characters helping you in your quest to attain Maslow&#39;s topmost tier. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although, now that you think about it&hellip; If you were part of a work of great fiction, who would you paint yourself to be? How would you introduce your character? You think having to keep up a &quot;character&quot; with a certain &quot;personality&quot; all the time would tire you out. As your &quot;beskie&quot; said, you prefer to be &quot;sudden&quot;. But who would even deem you entertaining enough to watch anyway? No one except the bored, the aimless, and those with too much time to kill, you presume. That&#39;s why you&rsquo;re 98% sure your existence couldn&#39;t possibly live up to a fictional title. And yet, you have a knack for trying (successfully or not) to prove yourself wrong. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Your name is Zephaniah Aisling, although Zephaniah is quite a mouthful, so on the rare occasion that someone actually uses your name in conversation they use the convenient short form Zeph. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Long story short, you&rsquo;re a pretty weird guy. At least that&rsquo;s the impression the rest of the class gives you. You can&rsquo;t help but feel every time you want to socialize, you unwittingly get blocked by someone else. And every time you do, people look at you like you&rsquo;re a made up character in a storybook. Of course, you don&rsquo;t blame them. You rarely blame anyone, because you know it&rsquo;s most probably your fault. Confidence just doesn&rsquo;t come as easily to you as it does to some other people you know. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You reach the ground floor after what feels like a one-odd page of exposition and head towards the cafeteria, where you figure practically everybody with a social life is probably currently at. Ah, lunch period. A reprieve from the horrors of the three-hour sensory assault before it. A refreshing stream in the middle of a haunted forest. An oasis of respite in the middle of a scorching desert. Before you can cook up any more metaphors you arrive at the place where they cook up actual food, and find your rightful place at a peculiar bench for four, somehow always half-covered in sunlight and half-covered in shade. However, just like any usual day, it serves its function as a bench for one. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You put your schoolbag down and head to the stalls to get some food. On the way back you spot one Sophie Keller waving rather enthusiastically across the cafeteria. You still don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ready to join her group of friends just yet. Firstly, a substantial number of them are from the neighbouring class and so they don&rsquo;t really know who you are, which intimidates you. Secondly, and arguably more importantly, they&rsquo;re mostly girls, which intimidates you further. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You want her to know that you&rsquo;ve acknowledged and appreciated her gesture, and yet establish that you&rsquo;re not really feeling up to it right now. So in a very Zephaniac fashion you stare back at her, raise your eyebrows quizzically and walk in the opposite direction. At least from what you see out of the corner of your eye, she returns the eyebrows, so you hope she gets what you mean.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You have a pretty decent and average lunch. It&rsquo;s the same bowl of rice with the same few meats and vegetables as you had around this time last week. No harm can come from the familiar, you always say. Plus, it&rsquo;s one of the less-patronized stalls in the cafeteria, so not only do you never have to queue up for your food, you&rsquo;ve convinced your altruistic side that you&rsquo;ve made some contribution to that kind old lady chef&rsquo;s revenue. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After you finish your food and return your bowl and utensils to the collection area like a Good Boy, you hang around idly and contently for another half an hour or so. Not having to entertain a large group of friends every lunch break can be liberating, you think. Imagine being there and, like, talking to people and all that. Heh. It would be really nice, but you already know every time you tell yourself you&rsquo;re going to make a change tomorrow you&rsquo;ll just end up repeating what you&rsquo;ve already said the previous day.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You get your bag and start walking off to the auditorium where the last (and definitely most exciting) period of the day, Drama, will be held. If all goes according to plan, which it usually does, you&rsquo;ll get there about 10 minutes before most others. But, you never know. Maybe since it&rsquo;s your birthday the universe will decide to surprise you or give you a gift. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Halfway there you feel a tap on your right shoulder, accompanied by a familiar, sing-song voice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">VOICE: Hey, zeph :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh, hey Avis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Being early as usual, i see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hmm yeah.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You&rsquo;re early today too though. I thought you&rsquo;d still be with your friends in the cafeteria around now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Well, i told them i&rsquo;d be ditching them a little early just for drama these few weeks</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Gotta prepare for the stage rehearsal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: Oh yes, you are the titular Mockingbird from the hit play </span><span class="c16 c20">The Mockingbird</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;by Samsara Fayruz. How could I forget?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Heheh~</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She chuckles: a warm, distinctive laugh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Are you jealous?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Jealous? No way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: If anything, I&rsquo;m horrible at acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Hmm, gotta work on confidence then. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: I don&rsquo;t know, acting is just kind of a mindgame</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: It&rsquo;s like a bunch of people decided to drop you straight into some weird fever dream and the person who plays along the best gets rewarded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah, it&rsquo;s all about suspension of disbelief, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: The what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You know, the suspension of disbelief.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Ehh i don&rsquo;t know what that means. I&rsquo;m not that good on the vocabulary</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well it&rsquo;s quite simple--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Hey on second thought i don&rsquo;t think i want to know. LOL</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You force out a smile, but it&rsquo;s a genuine one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Anyway, yeah. Guess in this class i&rsquo;m that person who came out on top. Just hope i deliver for the festival.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Eh I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll pull it off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Really?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well yeah, there&rsquo;s clearly a reason you were selected. I guess they see something special in you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You considered saying &ldquo;we&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Awww. You&rsquo;re being honest?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Honesty is one of my only redeeming qualities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Wow. Maybe that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re bad at acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heh.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You two reach the auditorium, still early, but around three minutes later than your usual time. A negotiable amount. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Alright, I gotta go get my costume and makeup done and all that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Catch you in the lights and sounds booth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Wow, you&rsquo;ve like, acknowledged that we exist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Do people not notice you guys?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: You, soph, 2 or 3 others?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I assure you, they don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Aw, maybe later in the play the mockingbird will fly up off the stage into the lights and sounds booth and give everyone in there a high five. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: We shall see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Heehee~ Ok i&rsquo;ve gotta go</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Wish me luck</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah don&rsquo;t worry about it, you have what it takes. I mean, that&rsquo;s why we selected you for lead role in the first place, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: Aww, thanks~</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">AVIS: I&rsquo;ll be sure to do my best for you guys :)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: All the best.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She slinks into the actors&rsquo; room backstage and closes the door behind her with an almost imperceptible click. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are actually quite impressed at how you held up against her. Avis&rsquo; personality is definitely not one you&rsquo;d trifle with. It feels like her vitality radiates from her in an aura, almost like she&rsquo;s bringing out the confidence in you whenever you talk. Anyway, that&rsquo;s about the third or fourth time you&rsquo;ve talked since you two have met, so you can&rsquo;t really make generalizations. You do admire her for that, though. Even when you first met her she already had something you&rsquo;d never see yourself having. Almost like it&rsquo;s effortless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everyone in the class has been so busily preparing for the Drama Festival that takes place near the end of the first semester. You feel a little pity for the aesthetic departments: when in comparison to whatever you&rsquo;re doing, it feels like they&rsquo;re doing way more work. Regardless, it&rsquo;s not your business to judge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After everyone arrives about 5 minutes after the formal start of the period (as usual), your class&#39; drama teacher, Mr Zac, gives a pretty long briefing on how the opening scene should feel like. Theoretically, everybody in the class already knows this, but this is the first time you guys have practiced, so you guess a reminder would do everyone some good. At some point the actors come out and you spot Avis and the other &quot;characters&quot; all in full costume. You must say, they look completely different under the spotlight on the stage, it&#39;s almost stunning. Looks like the costume people really pulled through on this one.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR ZAC: Alright children, rehearsal is the most important thing today. After this, we&#39;re done. LNS guys, get to the booth. Actors prepare yourselves. Rehearsal will begin in 5 minutes. Everything good? Ok, get going! </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the students scramble to their places. You do a sound check in the booth, and everything goes fine. Sophie runs a lights check too, and she gives everyone a thumbs up to let the crew know everything is fine too, although it seems more like she is on the verge of giving you a hug.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The rehearsal begins. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Curtains open and everyone goes silent. A dim yellow light casts its rays onto the floor of center stage, growing in intensity until it floods the whole set. Meanwhile, your audio crew plays a track of birds humming and chirping in the distance. The result is a serene image of a morning forest, basking in its own glory, teeming with flora and fauna.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You lean forward in your chair, attentive to the impending cue&hellip;always 17 seconds in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">14&hellip;15&hellip;16...17. You switch to another track.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Let the show begin.</span></p>
