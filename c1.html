    <h1 class="c12 c26" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c11 c13">Chapter I</span></h1><p class="c12"><span class="c22 c20">Fright or Flight</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c22 c20"></span></p><p class="c3"><br><span class="c1">Lights flicker red at the push of a button. The music jumps into a flurry of entangled notes, softly at first but with the promise of crescendo soon to come. Entering from the left starts a mockingbird, endowed with a single vibrant blue feather. She clumsily flies through the foliage to escape the hunter trying to capture her. While she evades the hunter&rsquo;s efforts, with her stamina fast depleting-- while she thinks it is safe, she is finally caught.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c18">MOCKINGBIRD: What are you doing, child? Please, please, release me!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: Why should I? You are a fine specimen of a mockingbird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c11">MOCKINGBIRD: I have been flying, flying away from my home, for I am no longer welcome there. Now there is a horrible, horrible hunter coming to strip me of my last blue feather.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10">CHILD: Do not be afraid, little mockingbird. I will keep you safe</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c11">MOCKINGBIRD: You will?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: I promise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: WHO BE THERE?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The hunter appears from behind a shrub, his voice looming over the pair of younglings as equally as his stature.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19">HUNTER: Boy, have you seen a tiny little mockingbird around here?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: No, I have not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: No? It was just flying around these parts. It is a vile creature, unlike the rest of its kind. I am only finding it for its one blue feather.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: Oh, well then I have seen the bird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: You have?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: It was flying through the trees, &nbsp;in the direction you came from. I did not know it was a mockingbird.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">HUNTER: Excellent. It cannot go much further than the clearing. Thank you for your guidance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c11">CHILD: You&rsquo;re welcome, sir.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The hunter continues his trek in search of the vile creature. With that, the child carries the beautiful mockingbird in his arms, and returns home.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR. ZAC: Hey, that was pretty good! Good job Avis and Jackson. Michael, you need to be more unfeeling. Not exactly bright and angry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c19 c11">MICHAEL: Sure thing, sir!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c23 c11">MR. ZAC: Other than that, nice work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c23">MR. ZAC: Ok, that&#39;s all for today people. Let&#39;s pack up and leave this place. The sun&rsquo;s going to set soon, and I wanna eat my dinner on time. Class dismissed!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">STUDENTS: Thank you Mr Zac!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The students keep the props, close the curtains and switch off the lights. As the three actors take off their masks and start chattering about the events of the day, a shy boy walking down the steps can&rsquo;t help but look at the trio and wonder what it would be like if he was among them, if only for a minute.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21">Another nice acting job by the three characters, it seems. While you&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of theatre, you appreciate all the effort it takes to keep up those appearances. You&rsquo;re terrible at pretending, you think. You&rsquo;d love to be on stage, commanding the attention of a whole audience, but if the past 17 years of your life have told you anything, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s not a good idea to have so many eyes on you at any one time. That&rsquo;s why when the class decided to do </span><span class="c21 c20">The Mockingbird </span><span class="c1">for the upcoming Drama Festival your school holds every year, you immediately defaulted to the Lights and Sounds section. Ironically, it&rsquo;s the darkest and quietest section of the play when it&rsquo;s actually running. Nonetheless you absolutely love your time there, because drama is one of the only periods where you don&rsquo;t feel like someone is watching you, waiting for you to do something stupid.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anyway, enough about you. Now&rsquo;s not the time to metaphorically beat yourself up, you already did that a few nights ago. Also, today&rsquo;s your birthday for goodness sake! You&rsquo;re allowed to celebrate what little character strengths you have, if only for a single day. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You walk out the school gate with a little more spring in your step than usual, catching your neighbour and close friend near the bus stop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hey, Alex!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh heeey. what&rsquo;s up, bro?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Nothing much. Just got off the last period which was drama.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c14">ALEX: man, I love drama. you know, the Drama Fest is coming up pretty soon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: what play is your class doin&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: Oh, we&rsquo;re doing </span><span class="c16 c20">The Mockingbird </span><span class="c2">by Samsara Fayruz. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14">ALEX: haven&rsquo;t heard of it. my class really wanted to do </span><span class="c5">1984</span><span class="c14 c11">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Wasn&rsquo;t that a novel?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: yeah, the original was written by some guy called Jorjor Well. so we&rsquo;re following some random guy&rsquo;s drama adaptation, and it&rsquo;s shaping up quite nice if I do say so myself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well, that&rsquo;s great for you guys.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: still chillin&rsquo; in the LNS?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Yeah, there&rsquo;s no place like it. I really love the atmosphere there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: or lack thereof. Heh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: it&rsquo;s boooring. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Psh, that&rsquo;s what you think.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: that&rsquo;s what everyone thinks, pal. why stay in that dusty cramped room with all the projectors and switches and knobs and equalizers when you can be out there, under the spotlight, acting on center stage? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He makes a dramatic clench of his fists, as if on cue, to illustrate his point. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: the gaze of the audience, transfixed on your every movement. man, knowing you have the power to change the audience, sway your character&rsquo;s fate, knowing you can be the one essential lens between fiction and reality, doesn&rsquo;t that excite you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph assembles every last shred of his melodramatic, performative spirit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: But fiction with all its own bells and whistles is still fiction. Predetermined, calculated, and even if followed to the dot and comma, is still merely an escape from reality which cannot hold forever. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: How stressful is it, leading the people watching you into your world of dreams, only to collapse it all into dust when the curtains close for the day?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I simply take no excitement from watching the whimsical or supernatural, and having people pretend it is real.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I like Lights and Sounds precisely because it carries with it its own reality, its own life in the notes and the chords, in the light and in the dark. It is its own pure simulacrum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: heh. that was a pretty dramatic monologue, I&rsquo;ll give you that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: maybe you really should be out there acting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heheh, big words coming from Mr. Second Lead Role, I guess.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: ehh, how&rsquo;d you find that out?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Word gets around. I eavesdrop on people sometimes. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Also come on, you practically radiate deuteragonist energy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: aww, I&rsquo;ll take that as a compliment.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The two talk all the way until the bus leaves their stop, past sunset. By the time they reach their houses, the night has fallen.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: alright man, great talk today.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: happy birthday, by the way. don&rsquo;t think I forgot.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh, thanks. I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it, actually.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My parents are out across the country for work this time of the month, so they did tell me to video call them for today.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: you&rsquo;ll be alone for a few days again? why not crash at my place? my parents and I can bring out the inflatable mattress.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My parents would object.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Well, that&rsquo;s what they would say if they were here!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: slumber party, woo!!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Heheh, I do want to cook something of my own, though. In case your parents made dinner or something again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh yeah, my mom texted me saying she was baking a casserole tonight. wait, hang on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: you don&rsquo;t mean your instant ramen stash, do you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hell yeah I do. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: oh my god.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Anyway I&rsquo;ve already chosen a pretty nice one for today. Tried and tested. It&rsquo;s a miso flavour.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: wow. whatever bro, it&rsquo;s your day. I won&rsquo;t judge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: expect you to be at my door in an hour? I&rsquo;ll save some cass&rsquo; for supper.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Sure, an hour is more than plenty.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c11">ALEX: enjoy your miso, man. see ya 8.20!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: See you in a bit, Alex.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You unlock the front door and enter. The house, once filled with warmth, feels cold and almost foreign. Well, that is, until your parents come back in a few days to lighten things up again. You love your parents. Unfortunate that they had to leave the state this morning, of all mornings. Anyway you call them once you settle down. The talk goes great, honestly. It&rsquo;s happier than approximately 85% of your usual conversations with your parents. Maybe about 50% if you omit all the laundry and dishes reminders. After you and your parents hang up, about 25 minutes have passed, and you&rsquo;re quite famished.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You open a cabinet meant primarily for laundry detergent, and remove the fresh-smelling fodder to retrieve your prized possessions. Ah who are you kidding, they&rsquo;re literally just packets of instant ramen. Your parents would murder you if they found out you spend 30% of your school budget by hopping over to the Asian supermart 2 blocks from school every once in a while and popping a few bucks on these babies. You&rsquo;re no ramen expert, but damn the Asians know their stuff.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You grab a Miso Flavour ramen packet. It&rsquo;s a well-seasoned taste you discovered a few months ago and have not been able to stop trying ever since. You walk off to grab a scissors to open the packaging, and--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c24">?????: hey.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">--wait what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: what do you think you&rsquo;re doing, buddy?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A calm and composed voice, rather similar to Alex&#39;s, echoes throughout the house and yet seems to linger just out of his field of view, trailing behind him like a shadow. A very puzzled Zeph checks the windows to see who it is, and finds absolutely no-body there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hold on, Alex. Where are you, exactly?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard your voice from the outside of the house.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">????? giggles softly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: silly boy, i&rsquo;m not Alex. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m inside your head.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: don&rsquo;t talk out loud like that, people will think you&rsquo;re going insane.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: And so I am going insane.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: no, you&rsquo;re not.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: you know, i&rsquo;ve been a part of you since the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;ve been watching, growing up with you, influencing you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph feels something step through the door and into the kitchen, even though the door is closed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh my god.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: What </span><span class="c16 c20">are</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;you?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i&rsquo;m everything you hate, everything in yourself you want to put away, your worst fears, your nightmares, your failures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph collapses into a nearby chair as visions swell up in his mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: why, i&rsquo;m everything you don&rsquo;t want to be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: and yet, i&rsquo;m everything you have, aren&rsquo;t i?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Holy shit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That&rsquo;s not true. You can&#39;t say that. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: come on, you can&rsquo;t lie to yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: </span><span class="c16 c20">[tearing up] </span><span class="c2">No&hellip;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: you&rsquo;re surrounded by massively more successful people, who have no time for all your whims and intricacies. you have no one who truly understands you, no one to tell your worries to, no one to be comforted by&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: no one to blame but yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Stop this, whoever you are, stop this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: if you ask me, it&rsquo;s PATHETIC.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: STOP IT!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Why are you coming to torment me, to remind me of all this on my birthday? It&rsquo;s nothing I don&rsquo;t already know! I&rsquo;m supposed to be happy, why can&rsquo;t I feel like it?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: hush, sweetie. again, nobody can hear you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: although, that&rsquo;s exactly my point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: i appear because despite it being your special day, you&rsquo;re all alone. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph breaks down and sobs quietly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: anyway, cheer up. i haven&rsquo;t bothered you much today, but i felt like now would be a perfect time to make myself known.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: we&rsquo;re only allowed to reveal ourselves explicitly from a certain age, anyway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That&rsquo;s&hellip;stupid and weird&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, rules are rules. oh well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Zeph picks up the scissors to cut open the noodle packaging.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: oh, and one last thing. i&rsquo;ve always wanted to try that really spicy korean one at the back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: &hellip;Why should I care about what you want?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: woah buddy, i sense some charged language right there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: My first impression of whatever you are isn&rsquo;t very good.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, i expected that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: anyway, just a suggestion. you don&rsquo;t have to do what i say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: although i would very much like you to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: which means at least a part of you will enjoy it as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: &hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You pause for a brief moment to contemplate it. You honestly bought that thing as a joke, a cruel prank to play on Alex, or anyone whom you happen to hate one fine day. But you guess the person you hate most right now is yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Fine, whatever. If even my own negativity manifests itself--</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: excuse me, &ldquo;herself&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Hold on, what?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: yeah, deal with it. this is the first time i&rsquo;m using a voice, though, so i just borrowed Alex&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: That explains it a little bit. Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be me?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: haven&rsquo;t you been curious to see who&rsquo;d you become if you were a girl?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Touche. Don&rsquo;t tell that to anyone else, though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: don&rsquo;t worry, i&rsquo;ll keep it to yourself,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">ZEPH: If even my own negativity manifests </span><span class="c16 c20">herself </span><span class="c2">and tells me to try a different flavour of instant ramen on my 17th birthday, then I must really want to try this, eh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: thaaaat&rsquo;s the spirit!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">?????: thank me later.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With that, the pressure and dread that had insidiously seeped into the atmosphere of the kitchen was suddenly lifted. Zeph goes to the ramen stash to examine the spicy ramen packet. It&rsquo;s touted as &ldquo;HOT Chicken Flavour Ramen&rdquo;, meant to be eaten dry. There is an unsettling amount of red in the picture of the noodles on the front. He takes the spicy ramen packet and puts the miso packet back in its stash to be eaten in a few days or so, who knows. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: I&rsquo;ve never been a person who craves spicy foods. Guess I&rsquo;ll get a verdict tonight&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He cooks the noodles, drains the water and mixes the flavour packets into the bowl. The resulting aroma is extremely enticing, although the noodles look even more red and intimidating than they did as advertised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: Oh boy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">ZEPH: You better be right about this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He begins eating and the pain gets to him, first on his tongue, and then flaring through his nostrils with subsequent bites. He got up again, two minutes later, to grab a carton of milk from the fridge. It was really damn spicy, but hey, it tasted really good. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A mix of pain and euphoria from the added spice. Zeph was hooked.</span></p>
